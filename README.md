# Homework-2

First I created 3 html pages: index, portfollio, and contact. 
I then began building the common elements of each page such as the header,footer, and navbar. 

I then decided what elements each page should have. 

The index was going to be my about me page. I put a card I found on bootstrap and inserted an image of myself. I went back later and added more of the details of what exactky would be in the main content of the page and did some css styling. I made the text centered vertically and horiontally as well as changing the font family. 

In my portfollio page, I laid out 4 cards with filler images that I will replace with my homework later in the course of this class. 

In my contact page I added a form for a person to write their name, email address, and a message to me. 

Im a css file I changed the background color, font-family, and I inserted a media quiry so my screen would be able to change sizes no matter the devise it was being shown on.
